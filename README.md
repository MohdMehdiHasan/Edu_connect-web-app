EduConnect - A Personalized Student Dashboard
Welcome to EduConnect, a dynamic web application designed to create a personalized and motivating learning environment for students from high school to college. This project was brought to life by Team Rocket to demonstrate a full-stack application using modern web technologies.

Our platform features secure user authentication, a multi-step onboarding process to tailor the experience, and a dynamic dashboard equipped with motivation tools, a daily login streak tracker, and more. The entire backend is powered by Supabase, providing a robust and scalable foundation.
